# Intro_to_Machine_Learning_Project
## *This was an Intro to Machine Learning project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project developed a Random Forest Classifier to recommend Smart or Ultra cell phone plans for fictional telecommunication company Megaline's legacy plan users based on usage patterns, achieving 80% accuracy on test data. The model provides a strong foundation for aligning plan offerings with customer behavior to improve satisfaction. Future refinements could further enhance predictive accuracy and drive plan conversions.
